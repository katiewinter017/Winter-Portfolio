# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

## Step 1: Chosen Visualization

For this assignment, I found a data visualization from NASA Earth Science in the artice, [Current State of Sea Ice Cover](/https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/cryo/data/current-state-sea-ice-cover)
I also found the related data for this visualization on the site [here](/https://masie_web.apps.nsidc.org/pub/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/seaice_analysis/) From that list of data, I selected the Sea Ice Index Monthly Data by Year which matched the visualization. This data shows how over time, both ice extent and the ice area of the Northern and Southern hemispheres are drastically decreasing. The data is brokent up by year and by month, ranging from 1979 to 2021. I chose this visualization because it addresses such a serious topic to viewers on how the arctic ice is declining rapidly, yet it feels a bit overwhleming and confusing. From my initial viewing of it, I started thinking of ways it could be improved.

## Step 2: Critique of the Visualization
For the critique, I utilized Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile and evaluated the visualization per each of Few's 7 listed criteria. They are ranked from 1-10, 1 being the worst, 10 being the best. The rankings and rationale for the 7 criteria are as follows:

#### Usefulness: 7
The information in the graph (showing the decrease in arctic ice coverage) is extremeley important information. Overall, the graph does do a good job showing how overtime the ice coverage has decresased significanty. However, regarding usefulness, while for a more expert audience both graphs may show different, valuable information, to a beginner audience, both graphs feel redundant. The article appeals to a more intro audience. Thus, I do no believe both are useful here. Also, I think that it is not necessary to have the full year - rather your eye focuses on the gap that can be seen in the late summer months. In recreating this, I may only focus on that difference. 

#### Completeness: 5
While the gap does tell a solid narrative, there are various elements missing. One, a descript title is not available. The graphs have a figure lable, but it gives no insight into what is going on. Also, regarding understandability, the stats on the chart create confusion and make the narrative feel overwhelming and not complete. 

#### Perceptability: 3
Regarding perceptability, the visualization does utilize illogical comparisons between months. when further examining the colored line key, the dates do not all correlate. While most of the lines represent 10 year gaps, there also is shown 2007 and 2012. This to me does not make much sense because those years would be lumped into the 10 year averages. I understand that the creator probably wanted to pull them out because they are more extreme low years, but it becomes confusing that they are pulled out but also included in the averages. 

#### Truthfulness: 7
Similar to the perceptability, the illogical comparisons make the graphic feel a bit untruthful. However, otherwise, the graphic does show accurate, valid data and attempts to represent it in a way that is easy to read. I also believe the graphic does a great job in labeling axis, using tick marks, and attempting to distinguish out years with color. While their could be less color, the intention was good in trying to create an easily understandable and truthful graphic. 

#### Intuitiveness: 4
While the type of visualization is intuitive in understanding the lines as different periods and showing a chang over time, it is a bit confusing. As mentioned, the periods are varying and not consistent. Also, the visualization/description (there is not title) does not really address the dip in the summer months. From first glance, it looks like theres a huge dip that is showing the decrease. However, the dip is not the decrease- its the decline in ice coverage in the late summer months. The difference is the varying depths of the dips. That took me a few minutes to understand. Also, during the winter months the levels are similar. To a beginner on this topic, this may seem like the ice coverage is not really changing much at all. 

#### Aesthetics: 3
When I first saw the visualization, the aesthetic stood out to me the most. It has a hand-drawn aesthetic that feels very child-like. However, the graph addresses a serious topic: the rapid drop in arctic ice due to global warming. Also, I do feel that the colored lines make the graph hard to distinguish what year is which.

#### Engagement: 8 
While this graphic may score lower in some areas, the data shown is very engaging. The visualization is telling a story about how much the ice coverage has decreased over time. This difference is easy to distinguish and see. Thus, the story it tells is engaging and makes the viewer want to learn and understand more. 

## Step 3: Wireframe
For the wireframe, I began by addressing each of the above areas and thinking about what things I could change that would make the most impact. In my critique, 2 recommendations I considered (that tie in together) would be to reduce color as the graph has too many colors that make it feel overwhelming and to only focus on the variations in the late summer months. Instead of using the line graph, I would perhaps use a heatmap that only focuses on the variations in the summer months and only uses a variation of one color. 
When implementing these recommendations - I utilized a heatmap to capture both the yearly and monthly data trends. 


Note: The small, and very quick, sketch of a line graph was added to the visualization during the class critique.

However, even after creating the wireframe, I could personally begin to think of ways to improve it even further. These ideas were confirmed and built upon in testing the solution.

## Step 4: Testing the Solution

To test the solution, I got the visualization critiqued by two different people. I chose two people with varying backgrounds to get different perspectives. 

Person 1: 24 years old, profession: Human Resources
Person 2: 53 years old, profession: Chemist

I asked both individuals the following questions:

What is your eye drawn to first?
What is the graph showing?
How long did it take you to figure that out?
Is all of the information useful to know?
What do you like/dislike about the visual?


The critique was extremely valuable in not only validating some of my initial concerns 

Additionally, while not part of the critique with the two individuals above, the class critique additionally helped significantly in testing my solution. During this conversation I mentioned that after my critique with the 2 individuals I was considering a line graph. Both students in my group agreed that the visualization should be simplified and that a line graph would better suit the audience. 


## Step 5: Solution

For the final solution, I leveraged all of the thoughts given in the critiques. Most important of a change was the overall emphasis on the audience. Because the topic is so serious in nature, the data should be easy to read. As discussed in the critique, because climate change is so weaponized, the visualization should be as straightforward as possible. Thus, I chose to move away from the heatmap and move towards a graph that is more widely understood and readable - a line graph. 

In fact, I did not choose just a line graph, but a line chart filled in - so an area chart. I chose to utilize this as it gives color more meaning. As mentioned in the critique, the dark blue was confusing as white typically means 'empty' or 'none'. Thus, in the area chart, I chose to use a light blue color to correlate with 'ice'. I also think the area chart in a way symbolizes 'ice' and better shows the decrease. 

Additionally, relating to the critique, I used individual years. Instead of the 5 year chunks, the area chart uses each year as a point - more accurately and truthfully showing the changes. 

The final solution:


I truly believe this visualization better suits the information. It is easier to read, tells a very clear story, and does not require any background knowledge on the topic. When I first started this process, I immediately thought I would know how to best represent the data. However, as soon as I started wire framing my test solution, I knew that I would need to reevaluate. The critique provided very useful perspectives and new ideas on how to better tell the story. Differing thoughts gave me better insight into thinking about my audience, the color choice, the impact of the graph, and the story it tells.
