# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

## Step 1: Chosen Visualization

For this assignment, I found a data visualization from NASA Earth Science in the artice, [Current State of Sea Ice Cover](/https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/cryo/data/current-state-sea-ice-cover)
I also found the related data for this visualization on the site [here](/https://masie_web.apps.nsidc.org/pub/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/seaice_analysis/) From that list of data, I selected the Sea Ice Index Monthly Data by Year which matched the visualization.

## Step 2: Critique of the Visualization

#### Usefulness: 7
The information in the graph (showing the decrease in arctic ice coverage) is extremeley important information. Overall, the graph does do a good job showing how overtime the ice coverage has decresased significanty. However, regarding usefulness, while for a more expert audience both graphs may show different, valuable information, to a beginner audience, both graphs feel redundant. The article appeals to a more intro audience. Thus, I do no believe both are useful here. Also, I think that it is not necessary to have the full year - rather your eye focuses on the gap that can be seen in the late summer months. In recreating this, I may only focus on that difference. 

#### Completeness: 5
While the gap does tell a solid narrative, there are various elements missing. One, a descript title is not available. The graphs have a figure lable, but it gives no insight into what is going on. Also, regarding understandability, the stats on the chart create confusion and make the narrative feel overwhelming and not complete. 

#### Perceptability: 3
Regarding perceptability, the visualization does utilize illogical comparisons between months. when further examining the colored line key, the dates do not all correlate. While most of the lines represent 10 year gaps, there also is shown 2007 and 2012. This to me does not make much sense because those years would be lumped into the 10 year averages. I understand that the creator probably wanted to pull them out because they are more extreme low years, but it becomes confusing that they are pulled out but also included in the averages. 

#### Truthfulness: 7
Similar to the perceptability, the illogical comparisons make the graphic feel a bit untruthful. However, otherwise, the graphic does show accurate, valid data and attempts to represent it in a way that is easy to read. I also believe the graphic does a great job in labeling axis, using tick marks, and attempting to distinguish out years with color. While their could be less color, the intention was good in trying to create an easily understandable and truthful graphic. 

#### Intuitiveness: 4
While the type of visualization is intuitive in understanding the lines as different periods and showing a chang over time, it is a bit confusing. As mentioned, the periods are varying and not consistent. Also, the visualization/description (there is not title) does not really address the dip in the summer months. From first glance, it looks like theres a huge dip that is showing the decrease. However, the dip is not the decrease- its the decline in ice coverage in the late summer months. The difference is the varying depths of the dips. That took me a few minutes to understand. Also, during the winter months the levels are similar. To a beginner on this topic, this may seem like the ice coverage is not really changing much at all. 

#### Aesthetics: 3
When I first saw the visualization, the aesthetic stood out to me the most. It has a hand-drawn aesthetic that feels very child-like. However, the graph addresses a serious topic: the rapid drop in arctic ice due to global warming. Also, I do feel that the colored lines make the graph hard to distinguish what year is which.

#### Engagement: 8 
While this graphic may score lower in some areas, the data shown is very engaging. The visualization is telling a story about how much the ice coverage has decreased over time. This difference is easy to distinguish and see. Thus, the story it tells is engaging and makes the viewer want to learn and understand more.
