# Part II

The following section dives into the second part of the final project, where I turn my hand-drawn sketches info full wireframs with actual data, storyboard out the different sections and how I want the sections to flow, and outline my story with my sources to begin writing the narrative. For this part, I additionally interviewed 3 individuals to crititique the storyboard and wireframes so I can strengthen them for the final project. 

## Wireframes and Storyboards 

For my wireframes and storyboards, I decided to lay out my story in Shorthand. Check out my wireframes and storyboard [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/lqXf2Erjw745Kduc)

Some key information still needs to be added to boost the over all story. Over the next week, in addition to making the changes from user interviews, I am going to work on actually turning the outlined story board into a full narative that is cited! However, outlining each section and adding key stats allowed me to better see what other information I could look for to boost certain areas. 

Needs: I still need to turn all of this into a strong narrative section that compliments the visualizations and provides some context. I also need to make sure all of my data is cited and that the images and color scheme work well together. 

Oppportunities: I have my data sources and statistics found that I want to use. I also feel like I made good progress on actually creating my visualizations in Flourish. I am looking forward to being able to incorporate the following user critique and strenthen my story. 

Overall, the narrative follows the following format: (I've inlcuded details on the sources I am using throughout these sections as my reserach is mostly done, I just need to turn the outline into a narrative).

Initial Statement: The Arts World Has a Money Issue.  The initial statement does not immediatley address pay as I am setting up my story to show the success of the arts world. I do not immediately want to throw out the purpose of the story as I want it to have a stronger impact as users read through. 

Setup: I am setting up the story by comparing the arts industry to Highmark Health. I chose this organization because of its prominence in Pitssburgh. Most of the target audience will be familiar with the size of the organization. The narrative section here will have data on revenues used from [Guidestar](https://www.guidestar.org/search). I am also pulling key statistics on the economic contributions and size of the arts/museum industry from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/1509/museums/#topicHeader__wrapper). I will also include a one sentence explanation of Highmark Health so the comparison makes sense to readesr.

Conflict: In this section, I outline all of the severe pay inequalities at organizations. I start nationally to paint a picture of these cases at some of the largest organizations. I then go more locally to Pittsburgh to show this is not jsut a unique instance. For the data, I chose to profile individual jobs from the [Arts + All Museums Transparency 2019 Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14_cn3afoas7NhKvHWaFKqQGkaZS5rvL6DFxzGqXQa6o/edit#gid=0), which is my main data source for the project. This whole section starts with a block of text where I overview this report and what it is, and why I am choosing to pull out individual cases instead of looking at the trends (because the top salaries skew average trends and do not recognize how bad the lowest salaries are). I chose to use a profile card approach to show that these are not intern postitions paying so poorly, but rather legitimate admin jobs that require advanced degrees and years of experience. Information is bolstered with top salary and organization data from [Guidestar](https://www.guidestar.org/search).

From there, my story segways into a section comparing these wages to the liveable wage in Pittsburgh from [MIT's Living Wage Calculator](https://livingwage.mit.edu/metros/38300).
I then included a small section where I am talking about why this pay issue is so bad - I think at this point viewers may be frustrated but not convinced why this is so bad. In this section I am going to explain how this leads to significant issues of the fact that theses jobs are not liveable and limits who can work in these positions.


Call to Action: The call to action prompts the target audience to look at ways they can begin to address these pay issues in the industry themselves. The bullets range in most difficult to least difficult so the last thing the audience reads is something very tangible that they can do.


## User Research and Interviews

Target Audience: 
The target audience for this project is my fellow cohort. Many of us will become leaders in the arts field that can advocate for change in the industry. Additionally, many of us are going into the museum field and need to be advocates for ourselves and negotiate for higher pay. Too often arts museums argue that they do not have the funds to pay workers, but I want this project to show future workers in the field that many of these organizations can pay fairly. 
Individuals in this audience group range from around 20 - 30 years old, have a masters degree in arts management, and have some level of prior expereince in the arts. Thus, the target audience will be aware of the industry and pay trends, but may not realize some of the instances I am pointing out. 

Identifying representative individuals to interview;
For this project, I chose to interview 2 individuals in my cohort, as well as 1 outside of it. Because my target audience is future art leaders (my cohort), I wanted to make sure a majority of the feedback I recieved was from individuals in this group. I also chose one person outside of this group so I could get feedback from someone who was not familiary with the arts industry or the topic. 

Interviewee 1: Male, early 20's, outside of cohort
Intervieww 2: Female, early 20's, part of cohort, 2-4 years arts experience
Interview 3: Male, late 20's, part of cohort, 8-10 years arts experience


| Interview Script Questions | Feedback/Findings | Changes to make to address this |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What did you like? | 1: I really liked the chart that showed that Art Museums do just as good as healthcare, if not better. That statistic is completely unexpected. I felt overall the infographic did a great job at highlighting salary disparity in the art world and I really enjoyed the charts used throughout the project. 3: Great design overall, Great pictures | |
| What worked well? | 3: 1st Graph: Works well horizontal, Graphs are simple enough to understand for all audiences. |   |
| What did not work well/was confusing? | 3: The first graph: The Carnegie Museum is significantly less than the rest and is not "Just as Good" as the title suggests. The second graph: I don't know what "Incomparable to One Self-Reported Income" means. Final Graph: Pop-Up boxes are not filled out. |   |
| What would you change? | 3: The things I listed above. |   |
| Did you find the story and data compelling? | 3: This paints a great picture and I can easily follow the data. I think the story shifts well from salary gaps to livable wages. I clearly see your setup, conflict, and resolution. |   |

Thus, moving forward, I plan to implement all of the listed changes above to clear up my story and data. I beleive all of these changes will not only make the story clearer, but strengthen my statement. In addition to making these changes, I will be working on turning the outline into a cited narrative and ensuring their is a consistent color scheme throughouth.
