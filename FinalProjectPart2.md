## Wireframes and Storyboards 

For my wireframes and storyboards, I decided to lay out my story in Shorthand. Check out my wireframes and storyboard [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/lqXf2Erjw745Kduc)

Some key information still needs to be added to boost the over all story. Over the next week, in addition to making the changes from user interviews, I am going to work on actually turning the outlined story board into a full narative that is cited! However, outlining each section and adding key stats allowed me to better see what other informaiton I could look for to boost certain areas. 

Overall, the narrative follows the following format:



## User research and interviews

Target Audience: 
The target audience for this project is my fellow cohort. Many of us will become leaders in the arts field that can advocate for change in the industry. Additionally, many of us are going into the museum field and need to be advocates for ourselves and negotiate for higher pay. Too often arts museums argue that they do not have the funds to pay workers, but I want this project to show future workers in the field that many of these organizations can pay fairly. 
Individuals in this audience group range from around 20 - 30 years old, have a masters degree in arts management, and have some level of prior expereince in the arts. Thus, the target audience will be aware of the industry and pay trends, but may not realize some of the instances I am pointing out. 

Identifying representative individuals to interview;
For this project, I chose to interview 2 individuals in my cohort, as well as 1 outside of it. Because my target audience is future art leaders (my cohort), I wanted to make sure a majority of the feedback I recieved was from individuals in this group. I also chose one person outside of this group so I could get feedback from someone who was not familiary with the arts industry or the topic. 

Interviewee 1: Male, early 20's, outside of cohort
Intervieww 2: Female, early 20's, part of cohort, 2-4 years arts experience
Interview 3: Male, late 20's, part of cohort, 8-10 years arts experience

c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.
