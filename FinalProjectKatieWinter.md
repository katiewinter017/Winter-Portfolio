# Part 1

## An Outline

Draft Title: The Arts World has a Money Issue
A high-level summary:
Because executives in the arts industy make uncomparable wages to their employees, arts workers and artists need to be paid more.
I want the reader (my fellow colleages in the arts world) to understand the disparities that exist and how severe/urgent they are so they can better allocate wages and negotiate for their own wages in their careers in the arts. 

Project Structure: 

Set up: Museum operating budgets are growing, as are salaries (showing increases in operating budgets, and trends in increases in exec pay and bonuses)

Conflict: While museum budgets and exec salaries grow, arts workers stagnant salaries are uncomparable. (comparing the very low worker salaries with exec salaries, analyzing how many years of experience/degrees still lead to low wages, etc)

Resolution: Arts managers need to better allocate money, workers need to continue to negotiate (showing raises compared to exec bonuses, etc)


## Initial Sketches

Some of the initial sketches reflecting the above draft outline are shown below. While these are inaccurate and not based on data, they show what sorts of data visualizations I am thinking of using for the data and story:

After doing these sketches, I realized I want more green throughout. I believe green will work well with money imagery. Additionally, I want to try to make the cash stacks (in the conflict) visualization work, and am thinking I may need to use photoshop for that. Otherwise, I think doing the sketches set me up to start thinking about how I can work with the data to tell the story I want. 

## The Data

For this project, I am using mainly one data source. There are many sources of what artists make - but my story mainly focuses on the pay disparity between arts workers and arts executives. Thus- I am  using the public data set, [Arts + All Museums Salary Transparency](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14_cn3afoas7NhKvHWaFKqQGkaZS5rvL6DFxzGqXQa6o/edit#gid=0) This source will be where I pull mostly all of my data for the project. This specific source includes a range of important data for my story. The first tab includes salaries from various arts workers. This data is also detailed in that it gives the name (or a descriptive name) of the museum/org they work at, their role, department, city, country, starting salary, year of starting, current salary (as of 2019), hourlty demands, benefits, years of experience, gender and race (both optional), and degree level required for the position. I am really excited to use this sources because this was a massively important report in the art world that was relesased just a few years ago. Many arts leaders have talked about this report a ton since it was public. However, I have not seen any one analyze or examine the data yet. Also, while many articles have referenced the data set, I have not seen any visualize the data. 

This data set will also be extremely useful to my project as it not only gives salary information, but it also has another tab on Museum Top Salaries. This tab lists out the name of an institution, the link to its Tax form 990, and the top salary listed at the organization, the title associated with that salary, the total compensation of that position (with bonuses and benefits), the 10th highest salary, the 10th highest salary title, and the 10th highest salary total compensation (with bonuses and benefits). Notable, this tab also has a column for operating budget. This will be important to draw comparisons to what proportion of the operating budget that the top salary accounts for. On this tab, while most of the information is good - it only details 25 organizations. While I do believe that will be enough for my project- I can imagine I may have to use Guidestar to 'fill in the blanks.' [Guidestar](https://www.guidestar.org/) is a website that provides tax document information for nonprofit organizations. From this, I can pull any additional museum top salary information as needed. However, I do think that the Arts + All Museums Salary may give me all of the data I need to create a very strong story. 


## Method and Medium 

For the final project I will be using Shorthand. I decided to go with Shorthand after seeing how streamlined the final designs were. After seeing the samples in class, they felt much more engaging and interesting than a powerpoint. Also, Shorthand's website shows various examples of successful digital stories from organizations like BBC, Honda, University of Cambridge, etc. 

Additionally, while there are may be other options to use, I am looking to try out something new. I have not ever used Shorthand before, so I think it will be a beneficial expereince to see how the platform works. Moving forward then, I will have experience with Shorthand incase I ever need to use it again in my career.
