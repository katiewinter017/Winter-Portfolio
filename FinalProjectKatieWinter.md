# Part 1

## An Outline

## Initial Sketches

## The Data

## Method and Medium 
For the final project I will be using Shorthand. I decided to go with Shorthand after seeing how streamlined the final designs were. After seeing the samples in class, they felt much more engaging and interesting than a powerpoint. Also, Shorthand's website shows various examples of successful digital stories from organizations like BBC, Honda, University of Cambridge, etc. 

Additionally, while there are may be other options to use, I am looking to try out something new. I have not ever used Shorthand before, so I think it will be a beneficial expereince to see how the platform works. Moving forward then, I will have experience with Shorthand incase I ever need to use it again in my career.
