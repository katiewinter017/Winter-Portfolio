# Assignment: Visualizing Government Debt

[Link back to the Main Portfolio page](README.md)

Part 1: 
The following graph comes from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Developemnt (OECD) on general government debt, specifically GDP-to-Debt ratios for various countries. 

General government debtTotal, % of GDP, 2020

Part 2:
For this part, I took downloaded the orginal data set used for the above graph, imported it into Flourish, and then created the following visual:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8559765"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Part 3:
For this part, I once again utilized the same original data set used in part 2 and imported it into Flourish. This time, I chose to visualize the data using a Tree Map. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/8560076"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


Summary: 
The first method of visualization (horizontal bar graph) worked well for a viewer to clearly scan throught the different countries and see how the debt ratios compared in one specific year. The second visualization (a grid of line charts) worked well in allowing viewers to see all of the data. With this visualization, it is easier for a viewer to see how one country's debt ratio compared over time. Compared to the bar graph, it is much harder however to compare countries to each other at one year in time. 

I chose to utilize a Tree Map for the third visualization as this type of visualization allows for hierarchy to be clearly seen. I gave the visualization a title that emphasized the focus on the graph to be on the variance in the ratios. I felt this graph was a strong visualization as the numeric value of the GDP is hard to find meaning from. However, the comparison of different ratios has a more clear meaning. Thus, the tree map allows a viewer to see the size differences in ratios between countries in one given year. However, this visualization is not as strong as the grid for a viewer to see how one country changed over time.  

Additionally, regarding color, I chose to use one solid color for all of the countries. In some years, there was data for 37 countries. Using 37 different colors (even 37 different shades of one color) would be overwhelming to the viewer. Also, using a specific color palette of a few colors would not work either as some countries would then be the same color without any significant connection. Thus, for the one color, I chose a deep red color. In finance, green typically signifies surplus while red signifies a deficit. Since this graph showed dept, I chose red and selected a shade that would not feel too bold or overwhelming.
