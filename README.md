# About me
Hi! My name is Katie. I use she/her/hers pronouns. I am a second year student in the Masters of Arts Management graduate program at Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a Pittsburgher born and raised! I went to undergrad at Carlow University (the really small college next to Pitt!) where I received two bachelors degrees, one in Accounting and the other in Art. I have a background in Public Accounting and gallery management, and my love for Pittsburgh's vibrant arts community led me to pursue my graduate degree in Arts Management. With my background, I am interested in the ways arts organizations can leverage financial management, technology, and community partnerships to increase access to more community members.  
I am currently an intern at a local Pittsburgh non-profit, Steeltown Entertainment Project. Here, I am focused on finance, development, and program development, aiming to increase access and collaboration in the region's film and digital arts industry.Â In my free time, I am a content creator (I make and share food recipes on social media!), an artist, and a cat mom of 2. 

# What I Hope to Learn
In this course, I am hoping to learn more about ways to visualize data and how I can use data better to get points across or 'tell a story'. As a visual person myself, I have always been interested in data visualizations. From my time as in fundraising at a small nonprofit, we use data visualization very frequently to explain progress, show industry inequalities, and communicate ideas. I am really hoping to come out of this class with a stronger understanding of how I can do that better and improve those visualizations to be even stronger! 
After graduation, I plan to work in the creative industy in a management role. With my experience in finance and fundraising, I know that a stronger knowledge of data visualization will help me considerably in my future pursuits!
