# Final Project Part III
A look at the 'behind the scenes' of creating Part III

Over view of work done this far - 'behind the scenes look at how work was created for part three'
Overall, this project has changed significantly from the start. It is interesting to jump back to [Part 1](KatieWinterFinalProject.md) and see how the sketches turned into actual data visualizations. Looking back from Part I to now, my ideas have changed based on the data available, feedback, and my audience. 

A look at one of my sketches from Part I:




What that became in Part III:


In Part II, I built out these sketches into draft visualizations, using Flourish to visualize data.  I utilized data from the Arts + All Museums Salary Transparency 2019 spreadsheet to pinpoint variances in executive pay to worker pay and individually projile individual instances of inequitable wages. 

In Part III, I started turning my outlined story board into a narrative, diving deeper into turning my ideas and data into a story. 


## Changes Made Since Part II 

### Interview Feedback
The interview feedback was extremely useful in making concise changes that may have caused confusion. In my interview I asked the questions "What did not work well/was confusing?" and "What would you change?". The following chart lists the interviewees answers to these questions, as well as the changes I made responding to each feedback point. 

| Feedback | Changes Made |
