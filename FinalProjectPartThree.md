# Final Project Part III
A look at the 'behind the scenes' of creating Part III:

Over view of work done this far - 'behind the scenes look at how work was created for part three'
Overall, this project has changed significantly from the start. It is interesting to jump back to [Part 1](KatieWinterFinalProject.md) and see how the sketches turned into actual data visualizations. Looking back from Part I to now, my ideas have changed based on the data available, feedback, and my audience. 

A look at one of my sketches from Part I:




What that became in Part III:


In Part II, I built out these sketches into draft visualizations, using Flourish to visualize data.  I utilized data from the Arts + All Museums Salary Transparency 2019 spreadsheet to pinpoint variances in executive pay to worker pay and individually profile individual instances of inequitable wages. 

In Part III, I started turning my outlined story board into a narrative, diving deeper into turning my ideas and data into a story. 


## Changes Made Since Part II 

Since Part II, the majority of 

### Interview Feedback
The interview feedback was extremely useful in making concise changes that may have caused confusion. In my interview I asked the questions "What did not work well/was confusing?" and "What would you change?". The following chart lists the interviewees answers to these questions, as well as the changes I made responding to each feedback point. 

| Feedback | Changes Made |
| --- | --- |
| I would change the Privilege section to have different colored text and I would do a quick font check to ensure that all of the font types match throughout the course of the infographic. I would also recommend keeping a consistent color theme for the text/text background (i.e. black slides with white text are common at the start of the infographic, but eventually white slides with black text become common through the majority of the infographic, before finally reverting back to black slides at the end). |  |
| I would improve the titles on the graphs to be a bit clearer. Also maybe add some more context as to what exaclty the viewer is seeing in each visual |  |
| The biggest issue I found was under the Privilege section the text was black with an extremely dark background, making it very difficult to read. I also would like to see the What can you do section be larger, with a proper heading and more points and/or sources for how to help change the disparities. |  |
| I dont think I understand whats happening in all of the graphs. I think more information would help because I definitely have to stop and think about what I am seeing |  |
|The first graph: The Carnegie Museum is significantly less than the rest and is not "Just as Good" as the title suggests. The second graph: I don't know what "Incomparable to One Self-Reported Income" means. Final Graph: Pop-Up boxes are not filled out. |  |
